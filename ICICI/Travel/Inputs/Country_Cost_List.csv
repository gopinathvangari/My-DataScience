peninsula The seven emirates include Abu Dhabi Dubai Sharjah Ajman Umm al Quwain Ra s al Khaymah and Fujairah Abu Dhabi is the largest but Dubai is the most well known and frequently visited The United Arab Emirates is a very modern country immersed in culture and history The infrastructure in the country if very good but perhaps a little overcrowded Imports from the west are readily available in shops It s a very clean and modern country to visit and many people enjoy seeing this pristine side of the Middle East while others see it as little more than a Disney World style experience Part of the appeal in visiting the UAE is to see the extreme and impressive luxury resorts that are popping up in areas like Dubai and Abu Dhabi To simply visit these resorts is a very unique experience The two most famous resorts are the sail shaped Burj al Arab in Dubai and the Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi Both Abu Dhabi and Dubai have large expat communities so you will find many different European and Indian restaurants and brands for sale There are many large shopping malls and supermarkets where you can find anything you might be looking for There are also many western chains around including KFC McDonalds and even Ikea English is widely spoken particularly in the tourism industry so you should have very little trouble communicating Alcohol is available in most hotels bars and restaurants There is a law that requires a license to purchase alcohol but this law is often overlooked The license is a statement that the individual is a non Muslim A trip to the UAE really offers a glimpse into a world where cultures are colliding Conservatism meets modernism and technology is integrated with traditional values It s a fascinating place to visit particularly if you can take the time to get outside of the major cities and see what else the country has to offer At A GlanceThe weekend here is on Friday and Saturday Many businessmen work a half day on Thursdays

Prices are cheap however You can expect to pay about US 2 00 to most places within the city An additional US 3 may be added to the total during evening hours after 10 00 PM If you plan to travel between cities renting a car is a popular option Rental cars cost slightly less than you would expect to pay in the United States The beaches in the area are quite impressive and worth a visit The water is strikingly blue and very clean Recent construction has made the water somewhat more cloudy but it is still a very beautiful place to visit and not to be missed while you re in the area There is also some excellent snorkeling and diving in the Indian Ocean The water is very warm and clear The beaches can range from very touristy to almost isolated even near Dubai Wearing a bathing suit in

Mount Ararat and his descendants emigrated those lands In fact Armenians are the descendants of Noah s son Japheth Another fact about Armenia It was the first country in the world to adopt

Denmark Currently Copenhagen is still responsible for foreign affairs but many people predict that eventually Greenland will have full independence Greenland is about the size of Mexico although looking at it on a flat map can be very misleading as it looks about the size of Africa It also has the world s lowest population density Particularly in the small towns there are very few signs for restaurants or hotels so you may have to ask where you can eat or stay Nobody will mind giving you directions as they likely know where everything is and are often eager to help Southern Greenland is jokingly called the banana coast by locals as this is where you will experience the least extreme temperatures although it is still bitterly cold It is also the most accessible part of Greenland This

commonly used along the western coast but in the east the dialect is slightly different Both languages are quite difficult to learn due to the challenging pronunciation Almost all Greenlanders also speak Danish and some have a decent understanding of English It s worth trying to learn a few words in Greenlandic though as this can greatly improve your experience The official currency of Greenland is the Danish Krone In touristy areas the Icelandic krona Euros Sterling and US Dollars may also be accepted While the number of places that accept credit and debit cards continues to rise Greenland is still predominantly a cash economy Hotels and major chains may take credit cards but otherwise it s best to be prepared to pay with cash Every town has at least one ATM and many banks will give

your buck Most people end up flying or taking the bus because the ferries can be expensive However once in the country of Greece the ferries can be a great way to get around the islands fairly inexpensively Many people put a lot of thought into whether they should rent a car It is advantageous if you re hoping to visit a large number of rural towns that are served by only one or two buses a day If you are staying in more frequented areas then a car is more of a disadvantage as it can be expensive is a hassle and traffic accidents are not uncommon The best car rental rates can be found

entrance fees This is particularly true if you re doing a budget safari While you should absolutely negotiate on the price of your tour it is important to realize that the vendor will only go down so far because park rates are set It is recommended that you tip your guide and driver A ten percent tip is generally appropriate If your guide does an excellent job it s a nice gesture to pay a little more While it s good to negotiate on the price of your package don t skimp on tipping Most guides and drivers work hard and are away from their family for long periods of time If you ve traveled

meals out and souvenirs The trick is to make it lighthearted and fun View it as a game and you re less likely to get frustrated with the experience If the shopkeeper or vendor tells you that prices are set then they likely are and it s best to respect that If they re willing to negotiate then keep the tone light and you ll likely get a good deal Cambodians generally only accept bills that are in good condition Often time vendors will try to pass of their torn money on foreigners It will be very difficult to find a place that will accept such a bill If someone tries to give you change with a rough looking bill request another one This is acceptable practice If you receive worn out money from an ATM go into the bank immediately and ask that they change it out for you Otherwise you are unlikely to find a place that will accept the money Many people choose to volunteer with an organization during their time in Cambodia It is very important to choose a reputable organization to work

coast of Africa It is also the fourth largest island in the world Because the island has remained isolated from the mainland it has a unique diversity of plants and animals that can not be found anywhere else in the world 90 of the islands plants are unique to Madagascar but many of the species are endangered due to human activity and deforestation Lemurs are a particularly famous animal found only in Madagascar Most species are considered either threatened or endangered Madagascar has tropical rainforest on its eastern or windward side and the western and southern sides are tropical dry forests thorn forests and desert because they are sheltered from the rain by the central highlands Madagascar s climate is tropical along the coast and temperate inland It is arid in the south There are two seasons in Madagascar a rainy and hot season that runs between November and April and a cooler dry season between May and October The island itself has a good amount of variation in climate due to significant variations in elevation The eastern coast has a sub equatorial climate and the most rainfall During the rainy season it is also prone to cyclones The central highlands are drier and significantly cooler but thunderstorms are common during the rainy season At A GlanceAir Madagascar is the dominant airline in the country A variety of domestic flights are available Internal flights are a good option because the roads on the island are in very poor condition Flight schedules change frequently so do check the status of your flight in advance Train is a slow and uncomfortable way to travel but it does offer some excellent views of the countryside It is also a cheap way to travel but if you hope to get a 2nd class ticket make sure you arrive early as they sell out quickly and advanced booking is not an option Biking in Madagascar is a great way to explore the island There is very little traffic so it is possible to cruise along safely down the road You can stay in the many small towns and villages and really get a feel for the countryside You will likely need to camp during some of your trip Basic guesthouses may also be an option The roads are in very poor condition so you must have a mountain bike or heavy duty tourer Rainy season is also tricky particularly on the east coast where the main north south road may become impassable Remarkably almost the entire island of Madagascar speaks one language Malagasy Although most people speak this language there are many different dialects but the Merina dialect is considered official Malagasy French is the official second language of Madagascar It is frequently used in business interactions but not everyone on the island speaks it proficiently Some workers in the tourism industry also speak basic

Niger River There s a traditional nomadic culture that still thrives and prospers in these areas You ll also find the fabled city of Timbuktu which attracts many tourists due to its far flung location Less visited but possibly more interesting is the city of Gao which sits on the edge of the Niger River It s in close proximity to beautiful sand dunes and is a uniquely fascinating place to visit In the western parts of the country you ll find a strong Muslim population mud mosques and a rich culture There are a variety of towns with outstanding weekly markets where you can interact with the locals and enjoy the atmosphere of daily life in Africa You can trek through the beautiful Dogon Country and see village life that has remained unchanged for centuries Mali offers a unique view into Africa What it lacks in wildlife it more than makes up for in culture Allow plenty of time for mishaps and unscheduled stops but take them with ease as they re all part of the adventure While Mali is one of the poorest countries on earth it is surprisingly more expensive to visit than you might expect The currency is locked to the euro and many prices seem artificially elevated There are very few hotels in most places and those that exist are high in price for a low quality room Food can range in price but often times meals are small in size This is particularly true with meat dishes and it is often recommended that you order vegetarian options as they are more filling for a fraction of the cost Transportation is also surprisingly expensive Coach style buses are usually your best option and prices are fixed and rarely negotiable In many cases it is beneficial to purchase tickets in advance to ensure you have a seat on the bus At A GlanceAlthough transportation is smoother and more comfortable than in Senegal it is still very slow moving Expect delays poor road conditions and overcrowded buses Still public transportation is an easy way to get around most of Mali as buses connect most cities and towns Many people fly in to Mopti and do a tour of Dogon Country before leaving There is so much more to Mali beyond this popular area Give yourself several weeks and you ll be able to see so much more from the Sahara Desert to village life along the Niger This is a fascinating and culturally rich country If you re in a town that is not a popular tourist destination you re likely to have a difficult time finding a good restaurant Most Malians do not eat out so restaurants can be few and far between Instead stock up on fresh fruit and produce Buy some bread and do your best to create a makeshift vegetarian meal This may be your best option Bring a knife with you You ll likely need it to cut up fruit or open cans Having a makeshift tool with you can really be beneficial and convenient A small and simple pocket knife is usually the best option Internet is available in most tourist destinations There is usually at least one internet cafe and many hotels have wireless internet available If you link in to the wireless internet you ll likely have to pay a daily fee of a few dollars but for some people the convenience is worth the added cost Related Looking for a

weekly market when villagers from around the countryside flock to the city to buy and sell their goods Timbuktu Perhaps one of the most famed destinations in Mali Timbuktu has long been romanticized by many travelers Many choose to make the long trek to this legendary town that sits far out in the Sahara Desert Popular Foods Food throughout West Africa tends to be comparable in style Malian food is heavy on the starches and carbohydrates and light on the meats You ll find the greatest diversity of restaurants in Bamako where you can enjoy anything from Chinese to Lebanese all for

Thailand lie to the east Bangladesh and India to the West and China to the north Although Myanmar is rich in resources it suffers from extreme poverty due to widespread corruption and government controls The country s culture is heavily influenced by both India and China There are stupas and temples spread throughout the country that are similar to those found in northern India Theravada Buddhism is the largest religion similar to that of nearby Thailand The dominant ethnic group is the Bamar although there are many minority ethnic groups as well each with their own culture and language The climate in Myanmar is broken down into three seasons The hot season runs between March and April and the rainy season is cooler and runs from May to October November through February is the peak tourism season and also the cool season Temperatures during the hot season can reach 36 degrees Celsius in Yangon while the highs during the cool season hang around 32 degrees Celsius Temperatures are moderately cooler in Mandalay and dramatically cooler in the highlands Myanmar can be broken down into six regions These include the lowlands of the Irrawaddy Delta Central Myanmar with cool hill towns and many archaeological sites Western Myanmar with remote mountain regions and beaches along the Bay of Bengal Northern Myanmar that stretches from the Himalayas southward Eastern Myanmar with the Golden Triangle and Southeastern Myanmar that borders Thailand At A GlanceBecause of Myanmar s tense political situation the country s infrastructure is in very poor condition Much of the western world has trade sanctions against the country making travel in general difficult Travel to certain regions is completely prohibited while other areas require a special permit or a mandatory guide The popular tourist destinations such as Yangon Mandalay and Bagan are open to foreigners but once you travel off the beaten path restrictions become a problem Any visitor may apply for a permit to visit restricted areas but these permits are rarely issued in a timely manner if at all Because the roads and railways are in such poor condition flying is the most comfortable way to travel around the country Myanma Airways is the state owned airline It has a very poor safety record and is best avoided There are several privately owned airlines that serve the major domestic routes within the country These include Air Bagan Asian Wings Air Mandalay Golden Myanmar Airways and Yangon Airways These tend to be more expensive but safer than the state run option The official language of Myanmar is Burmese There are also many ethnic groups throughout the country who speak their own language Mandarin is also spoken by the sizeable Chinese community that is most common in Mandalay Because Myanmar is a former British colony and English is still taught in primary schools many Burmese understand at least some English In larger cities you are more likely to find people who know enough English to communicate Those who work in the tourism industry also typically know some English Myanmar s currency is the kyat but foreigners are often required to pay for hotels tourist attractions train and plane tickets ferry rides and more with US dollars Other transactions such as tips and food must be done with kyat It is technically illegal for Myanmar citizens to take US dollars without a licence but this law is often ignored but do not insist on paying with US dollars Officially kyat can not be exchanged abroad so make sure to change it before leaving the country You may be able to change it in countries with large Burmese populations such as Singapore but do not plan on this Popular souvenirs in Myanmar include lacquerware that is made into bowls cups vased and more You can find this almost anywhere Myanmar is also known as a miner of jade rubies and sapphire but be on the lookout for fakes Tapestries called kalaga or shwe chi doe are also a popular item to

city of Ulaan Batar but smaller towns also host their own versions throughout the country If you do plan to visit during the Nadam Festival it s important to make reservations in advance This is easily the most popular time to visit Mongolia and the crowds will be at a peak While very few tourists actually visit Mongolia those that do almost always come during the warmer summer months You ll

many parts of the country are little more than tire tracks You can organize your tour after you arrive in Ulaan Batar Hostels in the capital city are usually the best place to organize everything If you re in the country during the summer months then you likely won t have any trouble finding people to join your trip Tours through Mongolia can range dramatically in length Most people choose to do a 7 to 10 day tour as this allows enough time to get outside of the immediate vicinity around Ulaan Batar but is still not too time consuming If you re hoping to see more of the country you ll need at least two or three weeks It may be more challenging to find others to join your tour if you go for this longer time period but it will be well worth the effort as you will see so much more Here is an overview of the tour we took with all of our fantastic experiences Before leaving for your tour it is a good idea to stock up on snack food Most guides prepare food for travelers and although the food

through There s a pedestrian sidewalk on most streets but like many cities in China the sidewalk can get quite crowded The streets don t seem to be laid out in the most obvious pattern so you are likely to get lost This is always part of the fun though If you find yourself in Cotai it is not advisable that you walk though as the streets are long with no real sights aside from the fronts of hotels Macau s official languages are Cantonese and Portuguese Cantonese is the most frequently spoken language and Mandarin is much less common Those who work in the tourism industry will likely speak a decent amount of Mandarin and some will speak decent English as well Do take note though that English is not as widely spoken in Macau as it is in Hong Kong Portuguese is no longer taught in schools so it is rarely spoken by locals It is often on signs and maps The pataca is the official currency of Macau It is pegged to the Hong Kong dollar and many places accept both the pataca and the

discovered than many countries in Central America and it s a little more rough around the edges than its neighbor Costa Rica but that only adds to its charm and appeal It s rustic nature also means it is a great budget destination where you can stretch your dollar quite far As its popularity continues to grow you can only expect the costs to continue to rise so now is really the time to visit Nicaragua while it remains somewhat undiscovered and off the traveler s radar You ll be surprised at how affordable a vacation in this tropical country can really be There are countless things to explore in Nicaragua There are great beaches with good surfing opportunities beautiful cities like Granada and outdoor adventure activites on the island of Ometepe If you re interested in hiking you

and beautiful beaches that are well worth the trip Nicaragua is a great travel destination for everyone Despite its low costs there are still some tricks for making it even more affordable Perhaps one of the most important pieces of advice is to carry small bills If you re crossing the border from Costa Rica in particular make sure you break down all your larger bills into change It is virtually impossible in some parts of Nicaragua to find someone to make change Food options are also very cheap in Nicaragua In particular try to dine at restaurants that offer buffets referred to as fritanga

you purchased them Store owners recycle the bottles and will give you a little cash back on your purchase It s also a great way to help the environment Also make sure you negotiate for prices particularly in markets This is expected and it can be a fun way to experience local culture At A GlanceTourism is continuing to grow throughout the country While prices still remain cheap demand

residents and tourists alike They are most often old American school buses that have been repainted to have a little more style and flare More often than not there will be some form of lively music playing and you ll find yourself sitting next to some form of livestock It s a great experience and an opportunity that is not to be missed while you re in the country Be prepared to negotiate hard for your taxi price particularly in the city of Managua There is no shortage of taxis so don t be afraid to let one go on by until you find one that offers you a suitable rate Make sure the rate has been firmly set before you get in the car Also don t be surprised if the driver picks up other passengers along the way This is standard practice if there are others who are headed in roughly the same direction It s important that you carry small bills with you while you re traveling throughout the country Most people don t have change for larger bills and it can be very frustrating to try and pay for something when nobody can make change If you re crossing the border from a neighboring country head to the bank before you leave and ask them to give you very small Nicaraguan bills This will help you out tremendously Related Looking for a party hostel in Costa Rica or Cancun Looking for a budget hostel in Mexico or Costa Rica Top Tourist Attractions Ometepe This large and dramatic island in

the war in its past do look beyond that and you ll likely have a unique experience in a less visited but culturally rich African country There are very few places in Rwanda that accept credit cards particularly outside of Kigali For this reason travelers will have to carry larger sums of money This is particularly true when traveling outside of the capital city where ATMs are almost nonexistent

least some insight into the challenges and thrills of visiting or living in an African country Because Senegal is a former French colony the predominate second language is French It can be difficult

restaurants good music and a nice selection of hotels where you can stay When you re in the town take plenty of time to wander around and chat with the locals The kids in particular are fun to play with Public transportation in Senegal can be one of the most challenging experiences Dakar s bus station is huge and feels disorganized when you first arrive Look for the small signs that tell you the destination of each bus If you find yourself lost a bus driver can often point you in the right direction Buses and shared cars depart for their destination when they are full Look for the vehicle with the most people in it as it will be the first to leave You can usually choose between a sept place which is a seven seater car and a bus Although the buses carry more people they usually fill up quicker because they are cheaper than the sept places That being said the sept places usually make the trip in a lot less time once they do begin their trip Senegal has many different area s which you can see and experience Try to take the time to head to a village area like Kedougou where you can see what rural life is like in Senegal Also spend some time in a city like Dakar or Saint Louis If

of most traveler s wish list and it s easy to see why it s grown in popularity Thailand is also a country whose economy and infrastructure is focused on tourism Because of this many visitors feel

a point of getting outside of the most touristy areas If you stay around the tourist crowds you ll have only a limited opportunity to see the authentic side of Thailand This is easily the most popular country for travelers in Southeast Asia It has stunning beaches in the south jungle and culture in the north and a city filled with night life and activities in Bangkok If you decide to spend a few days in Bangkok head to Koh San Road if you re looking to party hard If you re hoping for some isolated beaches head south to the national park beaches such as Koh Tarutao where you ll find few amenities but equally few people This is where you ll find one of the few isolated beaches in the country Whatever you do don t miss trekking in the northern regions in Chiang Mai This area is rich in culture and beauty Chiang Mai is also one of the best places to sample Thai food Food in the area is filled with flavors Its spicy but if you order it mild the restaurant often abides Due to its popularity Thailand is one of the more expensive countries to visit in Southeast Asia Even so the prices are dramatically less than those in western countries and many people find they can linger on

be much more expensive and in some places reservations are required as the rooms can fill up quickly The quality can also be frustratingly poor in some places so do make sure you see the room or read reviews before committing to a place At A GlanceBecause Thailand is one of the more touristy countries in Southeast Asia it s easy to get overwhelmed by the crowds and the hassle If you find yourself getting a little frustrated head to the northern parts of the country where the atmosphere is more relaxed and mellow The highlands are beautiful and you can have a wonderful cultural experience at a far more affordable price The food in Thailand is absolutely delicious It is generally served quite spicy and can overwhelm many people s palates If you re hoping for a milder variety of a specific dish ask for it with no spice While many locals don t understand the word mild they do understand no spice They usually abide by these instructions but not always If you re really enjoying the food in Thailand then consider taking a cooking class in Chiang Mai These classes often last a full day and they are loads of fun The teachers keep the classes light and humorous and the food provides a full days worth of meals You can often arrange classes through your hotel or a local travel agency Many people use VIP buses to travel around Thailand These buses are decent in quality but the connections are often poorly thought out and inconvenient Once a booking agent has your money you are really at their mercy Consider finding the local bus station and traveling with public buses which are far cheaper and often times more convenient There are many popular beaches in Thailand with some of the most famous being on Phuket Koh Phi Phi and Koh Samui If you re looking for a more remote and

Rwanda and Tanzania The country is known for its very diverse plant and animal life and is most famous as home to the endangered mountain gorilla as well as the endangered common chimpanzee Foreigners specifically caucasians are referred to as muzunga or wazungu in the plural form This term is commonly called out by children when they see visitors It is not an insult and a proper response is either to ignore it or respond with a friendly wave Uganda is not an expensive country to visit but the facilities are not what you might expect in neighboring Kenya or Tanzania as tourism is not as common Your best approach is to relax and go with the flow Understand that schedules mean little roads are in poor condition and part of the experience is to learn to let things go and stay flexible While most visitors come to the country specifically for a gorilla safari there are many other things to see in Uganda so don t limit yourself Other highlights include wildlife such as the chimpanzees hiking the Rwenzoris and visiting the source of the Nile River Uganda s climate is affected by altitude although the country is equatorial In general southern Uganda is wetter throughout the year On the northern shore of Lake Victoria most of the rain comes between March and June and November and December Near the South Sudanese border there is a dry period between November and February Droughts are not uncommon in the northeastern part of the country and Rwenzori in the southwest is prone to rain year around At A GlanceMost visitors to Uganda book a car through a tour company These companies provide a guide and a car bus or truck The benefit of having a guide is that they know where to take you and how to get around This is probably your best option if you want to see a lot in just a couple of weeks Otherwise you ll spend a lot of time waiting for rides and searching for accommodation Going it alone allows you to experience a different side of Uganda You ll get to know the public transportation and see a more local and arguably more authentic side of the country In general if you go it alone you will travel by a combination of boda boda local taxi bus and private car within

accent that may take you some time to adjust to There are also many different regional languages spoken in Uganda Some of the more common include Luganda which is common in Kampala and Swahili which is spoken in the north and the east Uganda s national currency is the Ugandan shilling At bigger hotels and restaurant you may be able to pay in US dollars It s also possible to pay for bigger activities such as safaris and rafting with US dollars In fact most companies require it Cash is preferred and a 4 fee may be charged if you try to pay with credit card Also make sure you have enough cash on you as it is not uncommon for ATMs to close do to a shortage of cash Plan ahead and assess the situation for each city and town you visit Accommodation provided by UWA in national parks is generally a good option as the standard is high and the facilities are less expensive Throughout Uganda you may struggle to find moderately priced hotels Expensive hotels are of a lower quality than those found in Kenya or Tanzania so you may prefer to stay at a budget hotel and spend your money in other ways Internet cafes are common in Kampala and Jinja In the larger towns it s possible to find at least one internet cafe but the connection is usually frustratingly slow and unreliable It is best to take advantage of the facilities in the largest cities and then disconnect for the rest of your

systems but the intercity transportation system is lacking If you hope to explore more than one region of the country it is advisable that you take a plane flight Flights can be reasonably priced and there are a handful of domestic airlines that serve the country For the best deals travel during the week and book your tickets well in advance While there may be some good last minute deals these are

difficult to travel around you ll do better if you visit one region at a time Some people choose to do a highlights tour and see New York San Francisco and perhaps one national park A better option is to pick one part of the country and explore it in more depth If you want to avoid renting a car the best area to visit is the northeast There are trains and buses that connect the major cities so it is possible to travel around without renting a car or taking a flight The larger cities in these areas also have decent public transportation systems so it s easy to travel within the city without a

that is forever working to increase its tourism base Although the growing tourism industry is improving the country s economy the travel infrastructure often has the feel of mass marketing that flocks visitors from one attraction to the next Still it is possible to step outside of this structured vacation and see more of the Vietnam that has existed for centuries Despite its popularity as a travel
